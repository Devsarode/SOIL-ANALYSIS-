# SOIL-ANALYSIS-USING-LAND-ROVER

## Features of the Soil Analysis Land Rover
 1. AI-Powered Soil Type Prediction
Uses a deep learning model (Keras-based CNN) to classify soil types such as:
- ✅ Alluvial
- ✅ Black Soil
- ✅ Laterite Soil
- ✅ Red Soil
- The Land Rover captures high-resolution images, processes them using pre-trained CNN models and predicts the soil category in real-time.
 2. Real-Time Soil Moisture Detection
- Equipped with a moisture sensor to measure the water content in the soil.
- Helps in precision irrigation by providing real-time moisture level readings.
- Data can be stored in a mobile app for analysis and decision-making.
- Can be used in drought management and smart farming.
 3. Bluetooth-Controlled Navigation
- The Land Rover is remotely controlled via Bluetooth using a smartphone or a joystick.
- Allows manual navigation for soil sample collection and analysis.
- Useful in remote or hazardous areas where human access is difficult.
- Can be integrated with autonomous path-following for smart operation.
